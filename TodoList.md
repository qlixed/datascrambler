#Quick and dirty TodoList

  * The Encrypt -> Split is the best method?
    * Maybe we can use/offer more modes? something like: split->concat->encrypt->split?
  * Check the code in py\_ecc, specially the Galois Fields code (matrix arithmetic) eficiency.
    * Is better to use numpy?, see the "cache" file generated and test if this is the best way to go (R) :P.
